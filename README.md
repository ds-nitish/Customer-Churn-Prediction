# Customer Churn Prediction with Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Model

This repository contains code for building an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to predict customer churn for a bank. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately predict whether a customer is likely to churn (leave) the bank based on their historical data and attributes.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of customer data, including various features such as customer demographics, transaction history, account information, and customer churn status (churned or not churned). The dataset is provided in CSV format, with each row representing a specific customer and each column representing a feature or the target variable (churn status).

Ensure that your CSV file follows the required format with labeled churn status and corresponding customer attributes. Perform any necessary data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering before training the ANN model.

## Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is a machine learning model inspired by the human brain's neural structure. It consists of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized into layers, including an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. The ANN model is capable of learning complex patterns in the data and making predictions based on the learned patterns.

## Usage

To use the customer churn prediction model, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Customer-Churn-Prediction.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Prepare your data:

   - Place your CSV file with customer churn data in the repository.
   - Ensure that your CSV file has the necessary columns for customer attributes and the target variable (churn status).
   - Perform any necessary data preprocessing, cleaning, and feature engineering.

4. Run the Jupyter Notebook:

   - Open the Jupyter Notebook `Customer_Churn_Prediction.ipynb` in your preferred environment (Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, Google Colab, etc.).
   - Update the notebook with the necessary path to your data CSV file.
   - Follow the instructions and comments provided in the notebook to explore the data, preprocess it, and train the ANN model.
   - The notebook will guide you through the process of data preprocessing, splitting the data into training and testing sets, training the ANN model, and evaluating its performance.

5. Evaluating the Model:

   - After training, the model will be evaluated on the testing dataset.
   - The notebook provides code to calculate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the model's performance.

6. Making Predictions:

   - Use the trained model to make predictions on new customer data.
   - Update the input data with the attributes of the customer you want to predict churn for.
   - The notebook provides code to preprocess the input data, load the trained model, and output the predicted churn status.
